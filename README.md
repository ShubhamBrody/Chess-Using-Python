# Chess-Using-Python

Hello Programming World!!!
A gamer-coder here.
hope to help and get help and Innovate.


This repository contains python code for chess. It still lacks international rules. I have made this chess game simply using basic knowledge of lists(majorly) and dictionary(very slightly used). NO MODULES IMPORTED
